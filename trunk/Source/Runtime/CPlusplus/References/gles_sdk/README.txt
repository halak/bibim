The AMD OpenGL ES SDK is a set of libraries and headers that developers can
use to create 3D graphics applications using the OpenGL ES 2 API natively on
Microsoft Windows® and Linux® operating systems. OpenGL ES 2 is a subset of
the full OpenGL 2 specification, but provides a smaller, lightweight API,
limited to the core functionality required to support fully programmable 3D
graphics, without the overhead of legacy features. With this SDK, AMD
provides fully compliant native support for OpenGL ES 2 and EGL on systems
running AMD Radeon™ HD and AMD FirePro™ graphics cards.
