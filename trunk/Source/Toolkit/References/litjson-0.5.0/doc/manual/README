LitJSON Manual
==============

This directory contains the XML sources for this library's manual in
DocBook[1] (v5.0) format.

Normally LitJSON is distributed with a pre-built HTML version of the manual,
so building it again is not strictly necessary. However, if you are
interested in building it yourself for any reason, you need to do the
following:

* Make sure you have a recent version of libxml[2] and libxslt[3] installed
  on your system.

* Create the 'docbook' folder in this directory. Under it, create the 'xsd'
  and 'xsl' directories.

* Download the XSD schemas for DocBook 5.0[4] and place them under
  'docbook/xsd'.

* Download the docbook-xsl-ns package[5], uncompress it and place it under
  'docbook/xsl'.

Once this is done, you can check the validity of the manual by running 'make
test' on this directory, or build the HTML version with 'make html'.
