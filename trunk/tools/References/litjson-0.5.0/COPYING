Thank you for reading this notice. Inspired by the enlightened words used by
the authors of another software project, a very popular one, also in the
public domain, here's a blessing:

  May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others.
  May you experience and share the gift of uncoditional love.
  May you see light, wherever the illusion of darkness appears.
